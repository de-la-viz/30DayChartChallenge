# #30DayChartChallenge

The #30DayChartChallenge is a #DataViz challenge by [@CedScherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer) and [@dr_xeo](https://twitter.com/dr_xeo). The categories are heavily inspired by @jschwabish's "[The Graphic Continuum](https://policyviz.com/2014/09/09/graphic-continuum/)" which was used as inspiration for the "[Visual Vocabulary](https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/)" by the Finantial Times.   

Every day, or at least for the days where I am able to participate, I will list my contributions below.
